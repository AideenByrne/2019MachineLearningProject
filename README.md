# 2019 Machine Learning & Statistics project
# Aideen Byrne 

This repository contains my project submission for the Machine Learning & Statistics module, as part of the Higher Diploma in Computer Science (Data Analytics) course at GMIT.

The project document is written as a Jupyter Notebook and saved in this repository as 2019project.ipynb. In order to run the project Notebook it needs to be saved locally as a .ipynb file and accessed from the command line using the command *jupyter notebook* which will open it in a web browser tab.
